      text: `# Vector Operations

Vectors are fundamental mathematical objects that represent both magnitude and direction. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the essential operations you can perform with vectors.

## What is a Vector?

A vector is a mathematical object that has both magnitude (length) and direction. Unlike scalars, which only have magnitude, vectors provide complete information about quantity and orientation in space.

## Basic Vector Operations

### Vector Addition
When adding vectors, we combine their components:
- **Component-wise addition**: (a‚ÇÅ, a‚ÇÇ) + (b‚ÇÅ, b‚ÇÇ) = (a‚ÇÅ + b‚ÇÅ, a‚ÇÇ + b‚ÇÇ)
- **Geometric interpretation**: Place vectors head-to-tail

### Scalar Multiplication
Multiplying a vector by a scalar changes its magnitude:
- **Formula**: k √ó (a‚ÇÅ, a‚ÇÇ) = (k √ó a‚ÇÅ, k √ó a‚ÇÇ)
- **Effect**: Scales the vector while preserving direction

### Dot Product
The dot product produces a scalar value:
- **Formula**: a ¬∑ b = |a| √ó |b| √ó cos(Œ∏)
- **Applications**: Measuring similarity, calculating work

### Cross Product
Available in 3D, produces a perpendicular vector:
- **Formula**: a √ó b = |a| √ó |b| √ó sin(Œ∏) √ó nÃÇ
- **Applications**: Finding perpendicular directions, calculating torque

## Real-World Applications

Vectors are everywhere in practical applications:
- **Physics**: Force, velocity, acceleration
- **Computer Graphics**: 3D transformations, lighting
- **Engineering**: Structural analysis, fluid dynamics
- **Data Science**: Feature vectors, embeddings`,
